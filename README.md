# Replication File for: "Estimating Jointly Determined Outcomes: HowMinimum Wage Affects Wages and Hours Worked"

## Data Cleaning 

1.	Download raw CPS data from https://data.nber.org/morg/annual/
2.	Get CPI from https://www.minneapolisfed.org/about-us/monetary-policy/inflation-calculator/consumer-price-index-1913-
3.	Run cleaner no comments.do (clean_morg_microdata.do is the same thing with comments) forvalues i=79/99{ } and then forvalues i=00/19.
4.	Obtain minimum wage by state data from Vaghul and Zipprer (2016), which is available at https://github.com/benzipperer/historicalminwage/releases.
